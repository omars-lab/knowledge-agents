# Documentation Rules

## ✅ Read Docs Before Making Changes

**Always consult `DEVELOPMENT.md` for context** before making structural changes:

- **Architecture patterns**: Dependency layers, injection patterns
- **Testing workflows**: Integration test commands, fixture patterns
- **Code organization**: Module structure, import rules
- **Development workflow**: Build commands, Docker setup

**Quick reference:**
```bash
# Key sections in DEVELOPMENT.md:
# - "Dependency Layers" - Architecture patterns
# - "Integration Test Commands" - Testing workflows  
# - "Development Workflow" - Build/test commands
```

## ✅ Update Docs for Structural Changes

**Update documentation when making big/structural changes:**

**Must update:**
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Architecture changes, new patterns, workflow changes
- `README.md` - Setup instructions, project overview changes
- `docs/*.md` - Specific implementation docs if patterns change

**Examples of structural changes:**
- Adding new dependency layers or services
- Changing import/architecture patterns
- Modifying test fixtures or workflows
- Adding new build/test commands
- Changing Docker/service configuration

**Update checklist:**
- [ ] Architecture diagrams/explanations still accurate
- [ ] Code examples match current patterns
- [ ] Test commands still work
- [ ] Setup instructions still valid

**Reference:** See `DEVELOPMENT.md` for current patterns and `docs/` for detailed implementation docs.
